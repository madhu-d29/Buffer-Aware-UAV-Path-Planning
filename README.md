# Buffer-Aware-UAV-Path-Planning
(1) Selecting RPs from a given set of nodes.
(2) Planning the UAV’s Path considering Time Windows.
(3) Dynamic Service Time Adjustment Algorithm.
The main focus is to optimize the UAV’s path and service time at designated Rendezvous Points (RPs), considering buffer status and specific time windows.
Finally for dynamically adjusting the UAV’s service time at each RP based on the buffer status. By proactively assessing the buffer status of each RP before each visit, 
the UAV adapts its service time while traversing the RP’s communication range.
